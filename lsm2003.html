  <em>The field of R&amp;D has much to learn from the open and evolutionary R&amp;D model upon which libre software is premised</em> </h3>
<hr noshade>
<br><br>
<p>By closely examining the evolution of the Linux kernel, we have come to realise 
  that management and structural organisation dynamics have played a major role 
  in ensuring the rapid growth that Linux has enjoyed ever since its inception 
  in 1991.<a href="#f1">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> Of course, this is not to say 
  that community ethics and norms are of secondary importance.<a href="#f2">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  On the contrary, one of the most significant accomplishments of the Linux community, 
  with regard to R&amp;D organisation, lies in its successful effort to bridge the 
  gap between a global developer community and various commercial players. The 
  beneficial effects of relations of interdependence in the R&amp;D realm have been 
  stressed before<a href="#f3">[3]</a><a name="3"></a>, although the diffusion 
  of such ideas has been limited due to the increasing corporate drive to pursue 
  innovation through institutions of proprietary knowledge (such as patents and 
  copyrights), which effectively reduce the incentive to share knowledge, and 
  thus reduce the potential appeal of collaborative R&amp;D endeavours to business 
  managers.</p>

<p>Crudely speaking, the success of Linux is not a mysterious cyberspace tale 
  that bears little relevance to the real world of R&amp;D and technological innovation, 
  as so many corporate managers reckon; instead the underpinnings of the success 
  of Linux can be traced to the emergence of a new commercial actor: community-managed 
  projects. In order to experiment with an open and evolutionary R&amp;D paradigm, 
  in which virtually every unit becomes actively engaged in innovation, Netscape's 
  decided to open the R&amp;D model of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> 
  project. This process of radical decentralisation, as exemplified by the Linux 
  development model, can be a realistic option for implementation across a wide 
  spectrum of industries.<a href="#f4">[4]</a><a name="4"></a></p>
  
  <p>In
fact, Japanese companies have been staggeringly successful in leading
collaborative R&amp;D projects. It is widely acknowledged that Japanese
organisations employ a longer-term focus than their western
counterparts, and that intra-industry sharing of information among
clusters of closely-knit lifelong business networks is the norm in
Japan. After all, the optimisation of dynamically re-configurable
supply chains around the timely supply of production inputs and the
equally well-timed synchronisation of supplier-buyer processes is being
commonly practiced in Japan since the 1950s. The necessary alignment of
operating processes across the group of industry partners, coupled with
the free exchange of personnel, ideas, products, and services within
the subcontracting network, culminated to the Just-in-Time phenomenon,
which preceded the explosion in outsourcing practices. This mindset has
certainly helped Japanese organisations explore win-win opportunities
in the pursuit of technological innovation, however, Japanese business
networks are usually hermetically closed to the outsider and the only
way to participate in those networks of business intelligence is
through official procedures and shared context provided by history,
geography, and other social and economic bonds. Therefore, there also
remarkable downsides to the Japanese version of collaborative R&amp;D,
most noticeable downturn of which is the case of managerial corruption
creeping into the system.</p>
  
  
<p>Interestingly, the approach of technology fusion<a href="#f5">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> 
  that Japanese companies such as <em>Fanuc, NEC, Sharp</em> and <em>Toray</em> 
  have adopted for organising their R&amp;D projects, unveils striking parallels to 
  the R&amp;D organisation of the Libre Software community. Technology fusion refers 
  to the process of merging existing technologies in order to produce hybrid, 
  yet entirely new technologies. For example, the fusion of optics and electronics 
  gave birth to fibre-optics. What makes this approach so special is that technology 
  fusion rests upon cross-industry relationships of mutual commitment and reciprocity, 
  and managerial reluctance toward partnering with external R&amp;D entities is not 
  an option as it destroys the very same capabilities on which the model of technology 
  fusion thrives. In other words, not only companies have to tightly co-operate 
  with companies competing within the same market, but most importantly they have 
  to forge partnerships with companies in otherwise unrelated industries in order 
  to tap into the (primarily technical) creative synergies that technology fusion 
  seeks to mould.</p>
  
  <p>First, everything starts with <strong>market demand articulation</strong>.
If the customer wants a new product or service, then that is the moment
an R&amp;D project is initiated. Once a market need has been clearly
defined, the R&amp;D attention shifts to <strong>gathering knowledge</strong>.
But intelligence gathering is no easy and error-free given that
companies have to gather knowledge from many different industries and
diverse sources such as industry and academic publications,
professional associations and clubs, universities and educational
research labs, government-run research facilities, and independent
technology houses, to name but a few. Hence, the process of collecting
and evaluating potential <em>candidates</em> becomes an
extraordinarily complicated task. The only way to enhance the
effectiveness of the research exploration is to distribute the task
across the tightly co-ordinated web of partners, and to involve as many
partners as possible. The diversity (in terms of diverse sets of
capabilities) that flows into the network ensures that a large enough
array of technologies will be considered and their potential will be
critically evaluated by those units possessing the most appropriate
skills. In doing so, an emergent self-selection of tasks takes place as
each unit focuses on its own area of expertise. As the R&amp;D network
gains access to more and more domains, the bonds of the R&amp;D network
are strengthened and this invariably sets a collaborative strategy in
motion. It should come as no surprise that those units (or clusters of
units) that finally come up with the best-positioned technologies are
the ones which emerge as the leaders of the project. This is justified
both in terms of their involvement in the <em>network of peers</em>,
but it mostly reflects their ability to convince the remaining partners
of the feasibility of their chosen re-combination. In practical terms,
if ten units explore the potential of ten different technologies, and
the third and fourth unit manage to persuade all other units that the
two technologies they had been investigating are the ones to marry,
then those two units will lead the project. We need to remind ourselves
that for such an R&amp;D approach to work, everything needs to be based
upon relationships of mutual commitment and reciprocity. Otherwise,
knowledge will inevitably fragment into clusters and will not be shared
with a detrimental effect on innovation.</p>
  
  <p>The final stage in the technology fusion approach is <strong>joint, cross-industry R&amp;D</strong>.
Having identified what the market wants and having concluded which
technologies will be fused, the network of partners proceeds on to the
actual development process. All partners contribute funds and specific
skills to the project and all partners benefit from the development
effort. This is a true win-win R&amp;D proposition: it reduces risk,
encourages innovation and growth through collaboration, increases
organisational learning, and seeks to bring useful technologies to the
market.</p>
  
  <p>By now, the parallel to the libre software
development process should be self-evident. Most libre technologies
initially aim at 'scratching a developer's personal itch' rather than
just being dynamic and confusing for the sake of technological novelty
and marketing hysteria. Furthermore, self-organisation around community
ethics and norms is common in the libre software sphere and as I argued
above similar community dynamics (mutual commitment, reciprocity,
network of peers, sharing of risks and benefits) play a pivotal role in
the organisation of technology fusion. In a similar vein, emergent
task-ownership and leadership is characteristic of collaborative
R&amp;D with all stakeholders being involved in the decision-making
process, and much of the development route being decided in an
evolutionary bottom-up fashion.</p>
  
  
<p>Indeed, as the commencement of several R&amp;D projects demonstrates, the focus 
  when trying to reproduce the key success factors of libre software development 
  should be on management and organisational aspects rather than obscure technical 
  issues.<a href="#f6">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> I am involved in one such collaborative 
  effort, the <a href="http://organis.org/">Organis Project</a>, which seeks to 
  provide autonomously run clusters of coding talent with the essential infrastructure 
  resources for the R&amp;D process to get off the ground while laying out the organisational 
  guidelines along which decentralised development over the Internet will be harnessed. 
  The scope of the project is not confined to software, and we are confident that 
  libre software development is a harbinger of an evolving type of peer production 
  activity that slowly but gradually rises to prevalence. </p>
  
  
<p>This presentation will delve into the organisational and management aspects 
  of libre software development and will suggest ways to apply its R&amp;D organisational 
  logic to other areas of production activity. The presentation will also address 
  the problem of bridging the gap between a non-profit oriented global developer 
  community and commercial organisations. However, I should mention that the element 
  of <em>intelligence gathering</em>, and in general the research component of 
  R&amp;D, will be analysed with reference to weblogs such as <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/">newsforge</a>, and <a href="http://www.openflows.org/index.pl">openflows</a>, 
  as they represent an immensely valuable resource embedded in the libre software 
  community. Weblogs' role in such collaborative R&amp;D efforts will be discussed 
  and thoughts for the future will be shared.</p>
