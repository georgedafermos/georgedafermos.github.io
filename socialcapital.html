<h2>Thoughts on the Intersections of Social Capital, Virtual Networks, Enterpreneurship and Innovation</h2>

<br>
<p>For the project to achieve fruition, there is a plethora of issues that need 
  to be clarified. I will shortlist a few basic issues that pervade the work of 
  leading researchers and practitioners and whose significance cannot be overlooked. 
  First and most obviously, how could social capital be measured, especially within 
  the context of virtual networks? Social Network Analysis tools are widely employed 
  for such purposes, however, their effectiveness is limited due to the difficulty 
  inherent in specifying which criteria should be used. Most analyses based on 
  such tools (ie. <a href="http://www.orgnet.com">Inflow</a>) value the connections 
  between disparate nodes of the social network in which they belong. When the 
  social network consists of a relatively small number of nodes, the analysis 
  will definitely unveil how frequently the nodes communicate and will choreograph 
  the information flows among them. What though the analysis cannot tell is whether 
  the relationship between the nodes in built upon strong or weak ties. Put otherwise, 
  we can infer the existence of a relationship between two nodes, but we cannot 
  determine the exact dynamics upon which the specific relationship is premised, 
  and frequency of communication is not the best of criteria since it may denote 
  hierarchy rather than intense team building or project work <a href="#f1">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>. 
  This difficulty aside, the Internet is bound to impact upon the process according 
  to which social networks are formed, and hence the way social capital is accumulated, 
  as &quot;social capital is about networks, and the net is the network to end 
  all networks&quot; <a href="#f2">[2]</a><a name="2"></a>. </p>
  
  
<p>Secondly, the process of innovation is continuously changing in scope due to 
  the amplifying character of all - pervasive communication networks, and this 
  further hinders an analysis based on conventional metrics. For example, the 
  nature of consumerism online can be radically different from the respective 
  consumption modes observed in the physical world. Unhindered by physical matter 
  constraints, users of file-sharing networks, such as the legendary Napster music 
  file sharing network, redefine consumption as an essentially peer activity, 
  which extends far beyond typical paid-for commercial experiences. In a similar 
  vein, economists have a hard time explaining why people share information online 
  without the requirement of quid-pro-quo relations <a href="#f3">[3]</a><a name="3"></a><a href="#f4">[4]</a><a name="4"></a>. 
  Or in the case of Linux and collaborative software development on the Internet, 
  the boundaries between producers and users are so blurred that this dichotomy 
  between production and consumption loses its meaning. Some have argued that 
  this is where the innovative potential of the Internet actually lies: networks 
  of users providing help to each other without expecting anything in return, 
  in much the same way that <strong>mutuals</strong> in the UK operate <a href="#f5">[5]</a><a name="5"></a>. 
  This peculiarity of the model has led many to assume the prevalence of a gift 
  economy <a href="#f6">[6]</a><a name="6"></a>, however, it is a mistake to categorise 
  the Internet as a mosaic of gift economies, despite that it arguably promotes 
  the proliferation of certain kinds of gift economies. We should not neglect 
  to bear in mind that the Internet is primarily a collaboration and communication 
  platform rather than a marketplace aimed at co-ordinating exchanges of goods 
  and services. Hence, it should come as no surprise that B2B e-marketplaces, 
  which are geared toward communication and collaboration and aim at co-ordinating 
  supply chains, are far more successful than B2C/e-tailing ventures that initially 
  dismissed the inherently collaborative character of the Internet. And this is 
  also reflected in the success of those early pioneers who have managed to stay 
  afloat despite the current economic downturn.</p>
  
  
<p>Amazon.com and eBay are probably the most succinct examples as they have both 
  embraced the contribution of end-users and have continuously rethought their 
  strategy in order to morph from e-tailers to platforms where people could do 
  a lot of things <a href="#f7">[7]</a><a name="7"></a><a href="#f8">[8]</a><a name="8"></a>. 
  eBay still portrays as the most gigantic marketplace in the world, however, 
  its real strength lies in its ability to build a massively decentralised database 
  of member profiles, which constitutes the pragmatic leverage point of the platform. 
  Users of eBay rank other users they have engaged in some sort of transaction 
  through eBay, and <em>this ranking mechanism emerges as the definitive asset 
  of eBay because it enables users to evaluate the credibility of other users 
  and this is the least-hassle route to reputation building in a dematerialised 
  world</em> <a href="#f9">[9]</a><a name="9"></a>. Amazon, on the other hand, 
  invites users to submit reviews of books they have read, and in so doing, a 
  conversational effect is evident throughout the Amazon platform with users seemingly 
  carrying out conversations and forming temporary communities of interest <a href="#f10">[10]</a><a name="10"></a>. 
  The underlying technology or process, called Collaborative Filtering, has drawn 
  quite some attention as it is reckoned to be in the epicentre of a radical shift 
  away from content based e-commerce models toward user and community centric 
  models. What is more important though, particularly with respect to innovation 
  and social capital, is that the very same process of collaborative filtering 
  enables the formation of social networks at a scale the world has never experienced 
  before. Witness the success of community sites such as Slashdot.org, which recycle 
  the web in real-time, and which rely upon their members to create content and 
  generate value. This genre of websites is also known as weblogs, although the 
  genre is as well defined as peer-to-peer to say the least. Semantics aside, 
  the technology that powers weblogs is not really novel, but the impact on innovation 
  and network formation is dramatic. Nowadays, scores of companies like Macromedia, 
  Microsoft, Apple, Demos, Groove Networks and Jupiter Research to mention but 
  a few, have started experimenting with weblogs in an effort to connect with 
  their market and benefit from end-user innovation.</p>
  
  
<p>Perhaps, the greatest challenge and promise at the same time of seamless communication 
  networks revolves around work organisation. As knowledge workers no longer need 
  to be physically located in a specific workplace, and they can co-ordinate their 
  creative output regardless of geographical constraints, the role of organisational 
  structure loses its historic role of managing power relations at a distance. 
  In much the same way, organisational boundaries tend to become more elastic 
  and flexible, and it is not rare to confront organisations whose strategy is 
  defined by their structure. Put bluntly, although at first glance conventional 
  structures seem to gradually evaporate, the overall importance of structure 
  is as important as ever. In a sense, structure precedes strategy <a href="#f12">[12]</a><a name="12"></a><a href="#f13">[13]</a><a name="13"></a>. 
  In fast-pacing industries fraught with technological uncertainty and galvanised 
  by rapidly changing consumer expectations, the only way to compete is by elaborating 
  on a fluid organisational structure that allows for quick adaptation to environmental 
  disturbances. Thus, strategy becomes of secondary importance, and day-to-day 
  management is what matters now. Under such circumstances, a rigid structure 
  is bound to result in managerial lethargy, and to ease this tension, organisation 
  around teams and projects becomes the norm. Nevertheless, this is not to say 
  that the boundaries of the network can be easily defined, as many organisational 
  actors may not be even conscious of those very swiftly adjusting boundaries. </p>
  
  
<p>Furthermore, when average job tenure lasts for no more than a couple of years 
  as it is the norm in the Silicon Valley, and the emerging model of organisation 
  is modelled on Hollywood, where individuals form ad-hoc, temporary, project-based 
  business networks and once the film - the project - is completed, the temporary 
  network disbands, then the corporate world is certain to undergo for a major 
  restructuring <a href="#f14">[14]</a><a name="14"></a>. Needless to say, this 
  process is further accelerated by cyberspace and the new legion of e-lancers 
  that discover new opportunities through always-on communication technologies 
  <a href="#f15">[15]</a><a name="15"></a>. Some speculate that the prevalent 
  organisational entities of the future will not be mega-corporations the size 
  of countries, but small clusters of e-lancers brought together for a single 
  project and continuously reconfiguring their dynamics and components <a href="#f15">[15]</a><a name="15"></a>. 
  So far so true, people no longer need to see each other in a face-to-face context 
  in order to work together. But, how can they trust each other if they have never 
  physically seen, touched, and handshaken them? And this is perhaps the greatest 
  obstacle that virtual organisations face: how to establish trust in a exclusively 
  virtual context where relationships and processes are in flux, and the lifespan 
  of the temporary organisation is meant to be so short that most organisational 
  actors will never get to really know everyone involved? The importance of swift 
  trust <a href="#f16">[16]</a><a name="16"></a> and weak ties <a href="#f17">[17]</a><a name="17"></a> 
  has been proposed as the antitode, however, the Hollywood organisational model, 
  again, offers a glimpse of the future to come: intense team building through 
  a shared goal and trust building through webs of trust. First, there must be 
  no ambiguity as to which purpose the organisation seeks to fulfil, and most 
  importantly, you trust the people whom the people you trust trust. After all, 
  centralised trust systems have always been inherently risky.</p>
