<h1>E-Customer Relationship Marketing<br>
 Promises and Challenges</h1>
 <br>

<br>

<p>In the below paragraphs, I will stress those issues that in my opinion are 
  of paramount significance for e-Customer Relationship Marketing (eCRM) systems 
  to actually deliver on their promise.</p>

<p>To begin with, I should clarify that although the roots of eCRM can
be traced to the domain of marketing, its implications go far beyond it
and could ultimately transform the scope of organisation within
industries.</p>

<p>In 1997, marketing revolutionaries Peppers and Rogers postulated
that if loyal customers generate the majority of profit and the process
of attracting potential customers and converting them to actual ones
constitutes a great financial burden - which is true given that
advertising costs represent(ed) the greatest expense in any marketing
plan - then marketing's role should shift from customer acquisition to
customer retention. By creating an interactive relationship and
constantly motivating the consumer to give more information, the
marketer can offer more products to satisfy increasingly more of the
customer's needs, argued Peppers and Rogers (1997).</p>

<p>Naturally, this value proposition did not go unnoticed through corporate radars. 
  Corporations no longer had to invest in attacking new markets and obsessively 
  trying to proselytise new customers. No more risk. Limitless growth and expansion 
  could now be achieved by focusing on your loyal customers. It really caught 
  on: loyal customers cost less to retain, are receptive to what the company has 
  to say or sell and they are the best marketers a company can have since 'word-of-mouth 
  is the most effective marketing of all'. What customers ask for in return is 
  a 'relationship', which on the marketing side, means '<strong>personalisation</strong>'. 
  And this was what relationship marketing aimed at. The so acclaimed during the 
  dot.com hysteria<a href="#f1">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>, e-CRM, was the e-version 
  of Relationship Marketing. Unfortunately, current mass customisation applications 
  and practices are premised on identifying common characteristics within large 
  customer data pools and then proceed on to some kind of segmentation whose focus 
  is always following the straight line from the company to the customer and the 
  market (Postma 1999) rather than from the customer to the market and the company, 
  which would have been rational given that the business world boasts an intense 
  customer orientation.</p>
  
  
<p>Theoretically speaking, e-CRM means using the Internet to better serve the 
  customers by getting to know more things about them. In practice though, e-CRM 
  referred to two distinctively different things. One was capturing as much as 
  possible personal customer information by tracking and monitoring every single 
  user 'click'. Long forms to fill in, data mining techniques, cookies, and prying 
  software that came to be known as e-CRM software was deployed to track how people 
  get to the website, why and when they leave and where they go next. The other 
  was replying to customer enquiries via email. No matter how simple this may 
  sound, there are plenty of corporations struggling to respond 'in a personalised' 
  - or simply humane - manner to customer enquiries via email. For CRM applications 
  to provide tangible value both to organisations and customers, this is a chasm 
  that e-CRM practitioners have to cross. <strong>CRM has to reconcile the tension 
  between centrally manipulated customer information and an enhanced user experience</strong>. 
  The role of User Interface knowledge is thus of primary importance, however, 
  theory should be complemented with practical and easy-to-use (on the user part) 
  technologies that maximise the potential for direct, humane marketer-customer 
  interactions. In my opinion, the technology/social process best positioned to 
  take e-CRM to the next level is <strong>Weblogs</strong>.</p>
  
  
<p>Weblogs<a href="#f2">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> are dynamic websites, that are 
  frequently updated - sometimes more than a few times a day and that allow and 
  encourage participation by users in the form of commentary. Although weblogs 
  have not yet gained momentum, several companies have gradually started experimenting 
  with weblogs for a variety of purposes. In a sense, Amazon.com is a weblog because 
  all products made available through the Amazon platform welcome readers' reviews, 
  in essence reproducing a conversational effect among customers. <a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/">Demos</a>, 
  the leading UK think tank, has a <a href="http://www.demosgreenhouse.co.uk/">weblog 
  as a PR vehicle</a>. <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia</a> deploys 
  weblogs for marketing, development relations, and product promotions (I wrote 
  about Macromedia weblogs <a href="http://hyperdrome.net/projects/publishing/hypertexts/2003/blogging_the_market.html#macromedia_is_blogging_at_full_speed_">here</a>). 
  In a nutshell, weblogs encompass many organisational processes and can be used 
  successfully for a wide range of applications.</p>
  
  
<p>Weblogs aside, it can be easily understood why manipulation of customers' information 
  is so appealing. Let aside Orwellian syndromes and big brother theories, <strong>cross-selling 
  opportunities</strong> that the shift to customer retention is meant to capitalise 
  upon, are hard to ignore. "The Web allows companies to draw a graph of 
  a customer's lifetime value. You can learn how customers end up in your fold, 
  which are the best and the worst ones, and why some abandon their shopping basket 
  before they make the final transaction" (Economist 2000: 43, 44). As a 
  result, in 2000, the <em>Economist</em> pontificates that there is indeed a 
  massive shift from acquisition to retention and emphasises that "companies 
  now also have the tools to exploit what they know about their existing customers. 
  Companies are starting to realise that they cannot offer the same quality of 
  service to everyone. They know that the true promise of customer data is to 
  help them to discriminate, in service quality and perhaps in price, and to target 
  their services so that they give priority to the most profitable folk on their 
  books" (<em>Ibid.</em>). Amazon.com is a good example of an organisation 
  exploiting the 'discrimination and cross-selling' promise of the Web. However, 
  its price discrimination plans largely collapsed when it was fiercely accused 
  of discriminating against customers by quoting different prices for the same 
  book (<em>Ibid.</em>). At the moment, most companies hesitate to accept that 
  such price discrimination practices are deployed or deny that there are any 
  such plans whatsoever. Especially when news travel fast through the Internet. 
  "I wouldn't want to know one of my customers bumping into another and saying 
  we had given them a better deal" says Cisco's Daichendt. (<em>Ibid.</em>). 
  While it is true that the Internet can provide marketers with a tool to determine 
  how customers react to variations in the price; customers may turn out to be 
  rather unsympathetic, thus driving the 'discriminatory strategies' in the underground.</p>
  
  
<p>Another major issue to be considered is <strong>automation</strong>. Organisations 
  have not yet understood when automated, out-of-the-box CRM software should be 
  used and when it should not. I have yet to come across a more lucid explanation 
  than David Weinberger's. <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/788/88uwdw.htm">In 
  his words</a>: "The irony is, of course, that although the Web is a deeply social 
  environment, Webizens are perfectly happy to have impersonal transactions with 
  companies. Off the Web, automatic teller machines are wildly popular--in part 
  because it's clear that they're impersonal cash bots. They don't pretend to 
  like us or even to care about us. Similarly, on the Web we're delighted to navigate 
  through screens to find the information we want even though--indeed, because--it's 
  so impersonal that it's nonpersonal. The problem comes only when someone tries 
  to jack the frame and to get us to believe that the page or the E-mail comes 
  from a human hand, when in fact it's just uncaring software". The solution to 
  this tension, according to Weinberger is to "either take the person out 
  of personalization or put a real person into it. But either way, make it crystal 
  clear which you've done". However, the problem is far more complicated since 
  the advent of Web services is likely to provide additional incentives to companies 
  to deploy non-customisable, generic and automated eCRM solutions. Indeed, the 
  impact of <strong>Web services</strong> on eCRM is bound to be dramatic. "By 
  employing universal, non-proprietary standards, Web Services dramatically lowers 
  the IT costs of collaborating with external partners, vendors or clients" 
  (<a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2002/04/12/execreport.html">Shirky 
  2003</a>). The sea change that component-based development (like Web services) 
  will bring about is most certainly to infiltrate the realm of eCRM by means 
  of integrating otherwise separate and non-communicating enterprise processes, 
  systems and applications (<a href="http://www.crmcommunity.com/library/white_papers.cfm">Selland 
  2003</a>). If such integration becomes feasible, the sharing of information 
  across teams, departments, organisations and customers will definitely result 
  in enhanced responsiveness to market needs and more effective sharing of customer 
  information. Needless to say, Web services are based on XML, which from a technology 
  vantage point, will empower end-users (end-customers) and enable them to easily 
  communicate with the company rather than merely consuming corporate - fed information 
  or filling blank spaces in a web-accessible marketing form. The avalanche of 
  industry transformations that the transition to a non - client/server model 
  of enterprise computing (that XML - based CRM systems promise to deliver) should 
  be borne to mind in future attempts to implement client/server based CRM systems.</p>

<p><a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="f1"></a> Philip J. Kaplan suggests that the eCRM 
  craze took off as soon as the dot.com bomb had landed (Kaplan 2002: 81). Therefore, 
  we can assume that Kaplan is referring to years 2000 - 2001 since the month 
  most widely associated with being the beginning of the dot.com crash is April 
  2000. However, the eCRM craze still persists and is often portrayed as the next 
  generation of e-commerce, which will certainly generate value for dot.coms and 
  bricks-and-mortar companies alike (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/technology/columns/dotcom/archive?start=60&amp;per=20">Walker 
  2001</a>). <br>
  <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="f2"></a> Weblogs are inextricably linked to the 
  process of social navigation and the technology of collaborative filtering. 
  For some, they are exactly the same and cannot be separated. Depending on the 
  underlying technical implementation, weblogs can either take the shape of a 
  market conversation and a vibrant community (such as <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>) 
  or a technology making recommendations based on patterns of past consumer behaviour 
  such as Amazon.com. <br>

  I will be more than willing to provide you with it.</p>
