  Recession is here, everywhere. Whether recession is artificial and thus compatible 
  with the axiomatic of capitalism (that is, the tendency toward a world market), 
  or forced and thus a threat to capitalism is still debated. From the perspective 
  of Capital, what is more important is that the historic magnification, which 
  has been defining capitalism since the 15th century, is not likely to maintain 
  its pace or character. There are no more barbarians to civilise, no more virgin 
  lands to conquer and colonise. The new barbarians are refined, the new virgin 
  lands are not defined by geographical parameters. Primitive accummulation has 
  been completed; explosion now gives way to implosion. It was reckoned that a 
  myth central to capitalism came full circle in three generations: I would start 
  from scratch with empty hands and empty pockets, slowly but gradually accummulate 
  rights and money, then build a house, find a wife with whom I would make a family, 
  then have a son and raise him, and, sooner or later, die. My son would repeat 
  the process once more, but his son – my grandson - would inherit more than my 
  son did, say three times more. In the elapsed space of three generations, total 
  wealth would have multiplied by nine times. This myth starts to shun all relevance: 
  the historic magnification of capitalism, based on long established materialist 
  notions of value, is no longer feasible. In all probability, my grandson will 
  not inherit three houses. And here comes the reversal of perspective of Capital: 
  as the concept of the spectacle is conceived to its full radicality, as a process 
  of generalised social abstraction, the commodity-form implodes to encompass 
  and invest all of shared lived experience. The commodity-form has gone well 
  beyond the romantic stage of fetishism: while there is no doubt that both the 
  use- and exchange-value of a product now largely stem from intangible characteristics, 
  such as perceived sex-appeal, "coolness", and ephemeral trendiness – a reality 
  of contemporary commerce which compels us to rethink value along the lines of 
  what Jean Baudrillard calls sign value – commodification does not stop at the 
  twilight of shopfronts and commodity shelves, that is, the sphere of materiality, 
  but it extends beyond them to encompass all of <i>the immaterial</i>. The leverage 
  and diffussion of commodification has been so overwhelming that goods long considered 
  public, such as century-old knowledges pertaining to medical treatments and 
  the cultivation of the land have been appropriated.<a href="#f1">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  In the age of universality of the spectacle, the ultimate commodity is the time 
  of our own lives, that is, the relationships and experiences that give meaning 
  to its space. "The spectacle is the moment when the commodity has attained the 
  <i>total occupation</i> of social life".<a href="#f2">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  In effect, nothing escapes vulgar commodification. Even some of the most subversive 
  and anti-commercial manifestations of shared lived experience have capitulated. 
  Indicatively, in the space of the last fifteen years, rave has metamorphosed 
  from an anti-commercial, underground social movement and cultural phenomenon 
  into a lucrative industry of cool. With the notable exception of freeraves in 
  England, the commodification of the pulse of rave is ensured by the increasing 
  centrality of the figure of the Star-DJ (and the ephemeral trendiness of the 
  Club) to the packaged experience. The associated process of social formation 
  during a rave is accomplished by reference to the sign value of fluorescent 
  Adidas trainers and ornament-ised Ecstasy. Rave is now about paying to dance 
  to the beats of a cultureindustry professsional, rather than realising temporary 
  autonomous zones through an intensive process of cross-fertilisation between 
  underground sub-cultures based on the free sharing of conscience.<a href="#f3">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  Presently, rave's claim to "hack reality" has given way to spectacular pomp. 
  Far from becoming a universal anti-systemic movement, as it once aspired, rave, 
  blessed by the high priests of the culture industry, became an industry of cool. 
  Now, more that ever before, the utterance "the poverty of everyday life" attains 
  a whole new meaning. It no longer refers to the near-complete lack of authentic 
  excitement and stimulation in shared lived experience, that is, an ontological 
  condition predicated on esoteric misery and social boredom; now, it comes to 
  signify the centrality of the commodity-form to the satisfaction and saturation 
  of all of our socio-cultural needs and wants.</p>

  Would-be information-technology (IT) workers are reckoned to be privileged because 
  it is assumed that IT students are in the rare position of needing none and 
  nothing, except for plenty of time perhaps, in order to acquire those skills 
  and competencies that will later guarantee them a job in the epicentre of the 
  most lucrative labour market. But this is yet another popular myth, in spite 
  of its been perpetuated by a plethora of computer scientists. In a time when 
  the tools of the trade are not free (libre) and certainly not free of charge, 
  free time does not suffice. This becomes obvious when we take a look at the 
  person who is constantly craving for fresh knowledge, in particular for knowledge 
  that has been put to the service of capital by means of intensifying and imploding 
  the wealth bondage that keeps unpaid-for labour hostage. The cost of the investment 
  in time required to pick up a new skill aside, what is left to the inquiring 
  mind who desires to internalise an external domain of knowledge, but has no 
  money to pay for it? Suppose I have no problem spending lots of time getting 
  myself up to speed with <i>Adobe Pagemaker</i>, <i>Logic</i>, <i>Cubase</i>, 
  <i>AutoCAD</i> or any other piece of software made possible by incredible programming 
  ingenuity, but I cannot afford to buy them. Do I abstain from using them as 
  the result of my inadequate funding? Or do I resort to programming a real alternative 
  (ie. <i>The GIMP</i> Vs. <i>Adobe Photoshop</i>), hoping that in time this knowledge 
  will compensate for the loss of familiarity in the use of the mainstream tool 
  which is the one valued by the market according to the particulars of the jobs 
  currently advertised? From this vantage point, <i>free software developers, 
  as well as illegitimate vendors of software, and people who crack software programs 
  are located in the vanguard of the modern knowledge revolution</i>. Although 
  they rarely understand the actual effect of their actions, illegitimate vendors 
  of software contribute a strong blow to the world of commodified knowledge. 
  For their clientelle consists not only of intermediaries who intend to copy 
  the software they have bought a thousand times and re-sell it, but also of people 
  who have a genuine interest in acquiring the knowledge embedded in the software. 
  Not that long ago, I happenned to stand right next to a <i>deal</i>. The site 
  was the famous agora of Monastiraki in Athens, Greece, located at the foot of 
  the rock of Acropolis, where hundreds of small-time dealers set up shop every 
  Sunday. The buyer had picked two or three CDs, one of which was a copy of <i>Avid</i>, 
  and was negotiating the price for that software. In order to raise the price, 
  I assumed for this is the only satisfactory explanation I can come up with, 
  the dealer cunningly offered that this deal <i>was</i> illegal. To which the 
  buyer replied: “I am doing nothing illegal here. I am not interested in re-selling 
  this software. I only want it for the knowledge in it. And no one will stop 
  me from acquiring knowledge”. The dealer, dazed a bit for it seemed he had not 
  been given that particular reply on that day, nodded and agreed on the price 
  the buyer had suggested. The deal took place, and in a moment's time the buyer 
  had dissappeared again into the crowd. The conscious realisation of the social 
  effect of knowledge acquisition through illegitimate and clandestine channels, 
  as exemplified by the determination shown by the above buyer to acquire the 
  coveted knowledge by all means, even through his participation in a deal, seals 
  the reversal of perspective: the perspective of power through the technique 
  of indoctrination it employs with the help of mass media has come into such 
  a fierce and cruel conflict with the imperatives of knowledge acquisition that 
  the genuinely inquiring mind will assert its right to claim knowledge even in 
  the obscene case that this process of knowledge acquisition has been criminalised. 
  The primacy to establish foundations for the advancement of illegal knowledge 
  can only be grasped on this plane: piracy is incorporated into the radical project 
  of libre knowledge insofar as the pirates are seeking to extend their body of 
  knowledge. As regards to crackers, they have been consistently portrayed by 
  mass media as juvenile delinquents on the brink of a terminal mental collapse, 
  whose kindest motivation can be explained by their vanity to demonstrate their 
  skills to others. But this conceptualisation, though it illustrates the underlying 
  motivation of some crackers, is far from adequate to explain the actions of 
  all crackers. The practice of cracking envisages the most radical aspect of 
  the project of libre knowledge: cracking does not stop at the boundary of illegal 
  distribution – it goes much further than that. Crackers devote their time and 
  skills to supplying the realm of illegal distribution with technology artifacts, 
  and, not to forget, there is hardly ever any money for them. In effect, this 
  critical aspect alone highlights the radicalisation of the cracker as a computer 
  scientist put to the service of liberating knowledge from constraints imposed 
  upon it by commodification. </p>

  <i>Free as in free beer</i> - The possibility that productive cooperation and 
  the enactment of production in social networks no longer require the mediation 
  of the capitalist in order to be effectuated – a presupposition of post-industrial 
  capitalism that some theorists refer to as the <i>Communism of Capital</i> – 
  is compelling enough to tremble the earth. A real-world demonstration of this 
  phenomenon is provided by the development and organisation model at work in 
  several large free software and open source projects, such as the Linux operating 
  system. In fact, many look into networks of collaborative free software and 
  open source development for a practical demonstration of how the <i>new</i> 
  emancipated society will be organised. There are several issues to be stressed 
  here. First, the absence of exchange value: free software, as a technology product, 
  is given away for free, and this is, partly, why free software is radical. However, 
  this fact may lead to wrong conclusions, for software is, by and large, a service-based 
  industry, and, thus, there is money to be made by capitalising on free software. 
  Indeed, corporate behemoths, such as IBM, are doing exactly this: they sell 
  services (<i>ie</i>. consulting, training, implementation, maintenance and support, 
  etc.) tied to specific FS/OSS products. Paradoxically, the absence of exchange 
  value does not negate the presence of market value. Further, not all FS/OSS 
  development takes place outside a system of economic incentives; as a matter 
  of fact, free software is often developed in direct response to market forces.<a href="#f4">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  On the other hand, it is common to underestimate the effect of such a paradigm 
  of (im)material production on consciousness and subjectivity. In editing Wikipedia 
  or hacking the Linux kernel, for instance, people are, <i>consciously or not</i>, 
  educating themselves in what creative, collaborative work really consists. The 
  realm of such networks of cooperative development is underpinned by the pleasure 
  principle: people re-discover that products of unparalleled social and technical 
  ingenuity can result from a production process that is founded on volunteer 
  contributions; they re-discover the joy and personal fulfilment that accompanies 
  creative work. On this plane, collective subjectivity is impregnated with the 
  sperm of radicality, as people are suddently becoming aware of the reversal 
  of perspective that lies in the shadows: a production setting in which people 
  are using the tools that they have themselves built to create situations they 
  individually desire is always bound to outperform in efficiency and expose the 
  poverty of production effectuated for the sake of profit. A direct confrontation 
  stretching from the terrain of ideas to the very institutional nucleus of capitalist 
  society is underway. One the one side stands the beast of living labour organised 
  independently of the capitalist demand, and, the imaginary of intellectual property 
  law, on the other. Whereas the beast of living labour seeks to gain its freedom 
  by demolishing a world shaped by forced labour, the object of intellectual property 
  law is the regulation of immaterial labour (rather than the creation of artificial 
  scarcity, as so many critics of intellectual property claim).<a href="#f5">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> 
  The imaginary of intellectual property law is, first and foremost, designed 
  to control people through control of the producion process, regardless of whether 
  this production takes place within the factory or outside it. Indicatively, 
  IBM has a patent on how to employ and retain FS/OSS developers, which means 
  that in an insane world anyone who has ever written a single line of HTML would 
  have to get IBM's permission to work at any company other than IBM.<a href="#f6">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> 
  Therein emerges a contradiction that FS/OSS is incapable of dodging, at least 
  for the time being: given that the time is ripe for the systematic exploitation 
  of immaterial labour, and draconian intellectual property regimes orchestrate 
  the production process in accordance with the exclusive interest of massive 
  intellectual property holders, the idea that radical subjectivity is being produced 
  in networks of collaborative FS/OSS development is thrown into insignificance. 
  Said otherwise: the global intellectual property law apparatus has both the 
  power to operationalise FS/OSS for the benefit of its master – the culturalindustrial 
  complex, and, most crucially, to render it illegal lest such a course of action 
  is deemed necessary. In the latter case, in which FS/OSS developers are marginalised, 
  and networks of collaborative FS/OSS development are effectively forced into 
  the computer underground, there is a good possibility that the subversive character 
  of FS/OSS will re-surface, but nobody can tell with any degree of certainty 
  whether its subversive motors are sufficiently equipped to deal with a world 
  pompously indoctrinated to the advantages of a draconian intellectual property 
  regime.</p>

  <i>The capitulation of volunteer labour</i> - Free (<i>gratis, unwaged</i>) 
  labour is a requirement of the current configuration of cognitive-informational 
  capitalism. There has never been a similar disruption in the number, and in 
  the composition, of the unemployed population. Nowadays, hordes of university 
  graduates and PhDs, that is, knowledge workers, are joining the boundaryless 
  'industrial reserve army' that sustains the delicate balance that, in turn, 
  restrains the contradictions of capitalism from exhausting capitalism itself. 
  It is to the credit of thinkers like Antonio Negri to have formulated the theory 
  of the internal margin, of how internal ghettos are installed within over-developed 
  regions and post-industrial metropoles in exactly the same time that under-developed, 
  and developing countries in the periphery are undergoing a process of heavy 
  industrialisation in agriculture and commodity manufacturing.<a href="#f7">[7]</a><a name="7"></a> 
  The structural violence produced by capitalism has run amok, giving rise to 
  such a dislocation in the labour-force that no expansion in any sector of the 
  economy will be able to absorb. And it is not likely that the historic magnification 
  of capitalism will maintain its pace, or character, in order to offset the systemic 
  shock triggered by the aggravation of the army of the unemployed. No previous 
  generation faced the problem of unemployment to the extent that the current 
  generation will be compelled to experience. It should not come as a surprise 
  when the "tag" of insanity will be bestowed upon those who are or remain jobless. 
  A number of pertinent questions arise: is this surge in the number of the unemployed, 
  and the similarly pertinent shift in its composition toward increasingly more 
  knowledge workers, likely to bring capitalism to a halt? Is this class revolutionary 
  or counter-revolutionary? To a certain extent, the unemployed constitute a singularity 
  deeply embedded in the revolutionary subject. Yet, against this pressure, the 
  system – apparently - does not break down. One could argue that the system feeds 
  on the fragile circumstances of the unemployed, seizing whatever opportunity 
  there is to utilise volunteer labour for spectracular goals by turning it into 
  forced labour: tens of thousands of volunteers were the human motor behind the 
  2004 Olympic Games, which took place in Athens, Greece. Whereas some of those 
  thousands of people surely volunteered because they wanted to volunteer - and 
  there is absolutely nothing reprehensible in altruistic volunteer work - , others 
  though volunteered in hope that once the Olympic Games were over, as it was 
  implied, they would find employment as personnel for the maintenance and operation 
  of the sites that hosted the Olympic Games.<a href="#f8">[8]</a><a name="8"></a> 
  This volunteer labour is conditioned by the structural violence of late capitalism. 
  Said otherwise: the unemployed (and under-employed) are forced to volunteer 
  their labour if they wish to stand a chance of escaping unemployment.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong><br>
  A new class has arisen that is rapidly ammassing increasingly more power through 
  its ability to <i>veto</i> on the vectors of information which it controls, 
  and which both knowledge workers and the industrial capitalists need.<a href="#f9">[9]</a><a name="9"></a> 
  This is the terrain of history where class struggle is being re-written. The 
  capitalist, as John Kenneth Galbraith observed long ago, has been a dwindling 
  figure in the economy. His hegemonic position has gradually been taken over 
  by committess manned by technocrats that Galbraith termed the technostructure, 
  and that we, today, would be more inclined to refer to as the class of knowledge 
  workers.<a href="#f10">[10]</a><a name="10"></a> The emergence of the technostructure, 
  argued Galbraith, was conditioned primarily by the imperatives of sophisticated 
  technology production. This still holds today: semi-autonomous knowledge workers 
  are a requirement of late capitalism, without whom the transition from industrial 
  manufacturing to information feudalism could not have been feasible. Yet, it 
  is misleading to assume that capitalism had, or has, a hard time adapting to 
  this reconfiguration: the constant presence of friction is not important, since 
  frinctionless capitalism, as well as static capitalism, is an oxymoron. On the 
  contrary, the capitalist system not only required the formation of this class, 
  but also incorporated it into its very operational logic. With the rise of this 
  new class, which McKenzie Wark terms the 'vectoralist class', and, which, it 
  should be noted, has its roots in the hacker universe, yet has chosen to dissassociate 
  itself from the interests of the 'digital proletariat', we witness the final 
  stage of the transformation of information into property. This transformation, 
  and the ensuing reconfiguration of class struggle that comes with it, are conditioned 
  by the inability of capitalism to maintain its pace and character of historic 
  magnification. For capitalism to elude the spectre of the falling rate of profit 
  and to extend its degree of accummulation, capital has to turn into an image, 
  and information, shared lived experience, and the commons be transformed into 
  commodities – commodification turns inward. The internal need for continuous 
  magnification, rather than ideology or class struggle, has led the convulsive 
  reconfiguration of the convoluted mesh of power relations and the associated 
  relations of production that are manifested as an intellectual property right. 
  The organic composition of capital may well have undregone dramatic change, 
  but the social worker of the present remains subordinated to a regime of spectacular 
  oppression; a regime that substitutes one class for another, yet still maintains 
  its class-based dichotomic character; a regime that by Marx's definition may 
  be seen as noncapitalistic, yet it is still epitomised by the axiomatics of 
  capitalism. To this day, the regime of signs founded on the emancipatory tendency 
  of the “general intellect” negates the old regime of subordination and work 
  done in factories and businesses, but it does so without negating its own Self. 
  Consequently, although fueled by a desiring machine predicated on social ejaculation, 
  it remains a regime of signs, rather than a concrete situation experienced in 
  the urban territory.</p>
